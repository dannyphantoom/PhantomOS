# PhantomOS Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-11-XX - 32-bit Stable Release

### 🎉 MAJOR: Boot Issues Completely Resolved
- **FIXED**: Infinite reboot loops that prevented OS from starting
- **FIXED**: QEMU immediately closing after bootloader message
- **FIXED**: Kernel loading failures and memory addressing bugs

### ✅ Bug Fixes
- **Kernel Size Issue**: Increased bootloader capacity from 16KB to 32KB (32→64 sectors)
- **Memory Addressing**: Fixed jump address from `0x100000` to `0x101000` accounting for ELF header offset  
- **Disk Interface**: Switched from unreliable floppy (`0x00`) to hard drive interface (`0x80`) with retry logic
- **64-bit Complexity**: Simplified architecture from complex 16→32→64 bit to stable 16→32 bit transition

### 🔧 Technical Improvements  
- Converted entire codebase from 64-bit to 32-bit for stability
- Updated all type definitions (`uint64_t` → `uint32_t`, `size_t` adjustments)
- Modified IDT structure for 32-bit compatibility
- Fixed linker flags for 32-bit ELF generation (`-melf_i386`)
- Enhanced bootloader with serial output for debugging

### 🧹 Code Cleanup
- Removed all debugging and testing files:
  - `boot_test.asm` (test bootloader)
  - `kernel_simple.c` (simplified test kernel)  
  - `kernel_minimal.c` (minimal VGA test)
  - `kernel_asm_only.asm` (pure assembly test)
  - `boot.asm` (original problematic 64-bit bootloader)
  - `kernel_entry.asm` (original 64-bit kernel entry)

### 📚 Documentation
- **Added**: Comprehensive README.md with usage examples
- **Added**: MIT License file
- **Added**: This detailed changelog
- **Added**: Technical architecture documentation
- **Added**: Build instructions and prerequisites

### 🚀 What's Working Now
- ✅ Reliable boot process from BIOS → Bootloader → Kernel → Shell
- ✅ Interactive shell with keyboard input
- ✅ Full POSIX file system (ls, cd, mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, cat, etc.)
- ✅ VGA color terminal output
- ✅ Interrupt handling and PIC configuration
- ✅ Memory management with 64KB pool

## [0.2.0] - 2024-11-XX - 64-bit Experimental (Deprecated)

### ❌ Known Issues (RESOLVED in v0.3)
- Infinite reboot loops during 64-bit mode transition
- Unreliable kernel loading from disk
- Complex bootloader causing system instability
- Memory addressing bugs preventing kernel execution

### ✅ Features Implemented
- POSIX-compatible in-memory file system
- Hierarchical directory structure with `/`, `.`, `..` navigation
- File operations: create, read, write, copy, move, delete
- Shell command framework with argument parsing
- VGA text mode output with color support
- Interrupt system setup (IDT, PIC configuration)
- Keyboard scancode to ASCII translation

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Attempted 64-bit long mode implementation
- Complex multi-stage bootloader (16-bit → 32-bit → 64-bit)
- 4-level paging structure (PML4, PDPT, PD, PT)
- Identity mapping of first 2MB memory
- PAE (Physical Address Extension) enabling
- EFER MSR long mode activation

### 📁 File System Specifications
- 64KB total memory pool capacity
- Maximum 128 files/directories
- Maximum 32 files per directory
- Maximum 4KB per file
- Path resolution supporting absolute and relative paths
- Unix-style error messages and return codes

## [0.1.0] - 2024-11-XX - Initial Implementation

### 🎯 Initial Goals
- Create bootable operating system from scratch
- Implement basic bootloader in Assembly
- Load and execute C kernel
- Provide interactive shell environment

### ✅ Basic Features Implemented
- 512-byte bootloader fitting in MBR
- Simple "Hello, World!" kernel output
- VGA text mode initialization  
- Basic memory layout and linking

### ❌ Known Limitations (RESOLVED in later versions)
- Boot failures and system hangs
